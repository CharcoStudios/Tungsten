Tungsten.Net.RPC is a client/server solution for invoking methods on a server.  Communications are made over the port you specify.  RPC methods on the server are created by attributing classes and methods with the [RPCClass] and [RPCMethod] attributes.  Clients make calls by passing in the method name ("MyNameSpace.MyClass.Method1") and any parameters to one of the Call or CallAsync methods.
