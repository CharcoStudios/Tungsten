Tungsten is a C# library to make application development easier.  See the wiki @ https://github.com/mode51/Tungsten/wiki for details, examples and use.

Added W.Threading.Lockers.MonitorLocker<TState>
Added W.Threading.Lockers.SpinLocker<TState>
Added W.Threading.Lockers.ReaderWriterLocker<TState>
Added W.Threading.Lockers.StateLocker
Added W.Encryption.AssymetricEncryption to facilitate assymetric encryption
Added W.Disposer which simplifies IDisposable.Dispose by providing locking and re-entrancy support
Added W.LockExtensions which provides extension methods for object(via Monitor), SpinLock, SemaphoreSlim and ReaderWriterLockSlim
Added W.ArrayMethods
Renamed W.Threading.GateMethods to W.Threading.GateExtensions and marked them obsolete
Added W.Threading.ParameterizedThread
Added W.Threading.ThreadSlim which uses ThreadMethod to present a simplified thread wrapper
Added W.ThreadMethod which wraps an Action or AnyMethodDelegate with additional functionality
Added W.Threading.CPUProfileEnum.SpinUntil which can be used in W.Threading.Thread.Sleep to specify a larger Sleep/SpinUntil value
Changed W.Property.ValueChanged to be an event and removed the constructors supporting it
Added W.PropertySlim
W.Lockable now extends W.LockableSlim and adds a ValueChanged event
Added W.LockableSlim which uses ReaderWriterLocker and is slightly slimmer than W.Lockable
Added W.Threading.Lockers.SemaphoreSlimLocker for easier locking
Added W.Threading.Lockers.MonitorLocker for easier locking
Added W.Threading.Lockers.SpinLocker for easier locking
Added W.Threading.Lockers.ReaderWriterLocker for easier locking
Moved AsExtensions into the new W.AsExtensions namespace
Moved FromExtensions into the new W.FromExtensions namespace
Moved DelegateExtensions into the new W.DelegateExtensions namespace
Moved InvokeExtensions into the new W.InvokeExtensions namespace
Moved StringExtensions into the new W.StringExtensions namespace
Moved W.PropertyHostMethods to the new W.PropertyHostExtensions namespace and renamed it to W.PropertyHostExtensions.PropertyHostExtensions
Removed ExtensionMethods namespace
Removed the autoStart parameter from the W.Threading.Thread constructor
Removed W.Threading.Thread.IsFaulted
Removed W.Threading.Thread.Exception
Removed the finalizer in W.Disposable

10.05.2017 v1.3.0
Added W.EventTemplate which encapsulates event creation in a template
Added W.Encryption.RSAMethods for NetStandard1_3 and NetCoreApp
Effectively rewrote W.Threading.Thread and W.Threading.Gate because they weren't working correctly
Added W.Threading.Thread.Sleep(CPUProfileEnum level)
Added overloads to W.Logging.Log.x methods which add callerName and callerLineNumber to the message
Added W.ExtensionMethods.WaitForValue extensions
Removed W.Threading.Thread.Cancel(msTimeout) because it called Abort which is the wrong place for Abort to exist
Added a W.Threading.Thread.Abort for .Net45

8.10.2017 v1.2.7.1
Corrected target framework order in NuGet package

7.31.2017 v1.2.7
Added W.Logging.Log.MessageHistory
Added support for NetStandard1.0 with most functionality (no encryption or compression)

6.22.2017 v1.2.6
All Tungsten projects now share most of their code from Tungsten.Standard (Threading.Thread and Encryption.RSA are about the only items not able to be shared)
Added NuGet targetframework netcoreapp1.0
Added Singleton<TSingletonType>
Added Property(TValue defaultValue, OnValueChangedDelegate onValueChanged = null) constructor

5.11.2017 v1.2.5
Added W.StringExtensions (string.IsValidBase64())
Added W.Logging.CustomLogger to make adding custom loggers easier

5.2.2017 v1.2.4
All target dlls are now named Tungsten.dll - this should help with cross-framework compatibility

4.12.2017 v1.2.3.2
Changed netstandard minimum from 1.4 to 1.3

4.11.2017 v1.2.3.1

Attempting to fix NuGet inclusion of Tungsten.Universal

3.30.2017 v1.2.2
Added ExecuteInLock/ExecutInLockAsync to Lockable class
Added additional functionality to W.Threading.Thread and W.Threading.ThreadBase
Updated some XML documentation

3.16.2017 v1.2.1
Added RSA encryption to Tungsten (net45).  It already exists in netstandard1.4 (it is not in PCL or Universal - and may never)

3.15.2017 v1.2.0
Merged Tungsten.Standard into Tungsten NuGet Package
  - Tungsten package now contains net45, portable, universal and netstandard targets

2.28.2017 v1.1.4
Had to remove Tungsten.Core from this package because NuProj doesn't support it yet

2.28.2017 v1.1.3
Merged the Tungsten, Tungsten.Portable, Tungsten.Universal and Tungsten.Core NuGet packages

2.16.2017 v1.1.2

Fixed As<TType> and AsJson<TType>

2.16.2017
Added As.cs which contains a number of extension methods for converting objects from one type to another

2.9.2017
Removed Tungsten.Threading.GateExtensions - the methods seem rather redundant or at least unnecessary

2.1.2017
Removed unused references

1.29.2017
PropertyHostMethods now actually exposes extension methods (forgot to make them extensions)

1.27.2017
Added PropertyHostNotifier which aggregates the functionality of PropertyChangedNotifier and PropertyHost
Fixed Property so it actually updates the UI automatically (Owner functionality wasn't working)
