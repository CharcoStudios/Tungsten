Tungsten.Domains makes it easy for your application to host child AppDomains.  These AppDomains are reloadable and can use shadow copy; this makes it easy to add a plugin architecture to your application or allow dlls to be updated while the application is running.

2.8.2017
DomainLoader.SetData and GetData no longer raise an exception if the domain hasn't been loaded; they quietly fail and do nothing.

Initial Release 2.8.2017

Tungsten.Domains.DomainLoader

Thanks for using Tungsten.Domains,
