Tungsten.Domains makes it easy for your application to host child AppDomains.  These AppDomains are reloadable and can use shadow copy; this makes it easy to add a plugin architecture to your application or allow dlls to be updated while the application is running.

Initial Release 2.8.2017

Tungsten.Domains.DomainLoader - this is the class you'll want to use in your app
Tungsten.Domains.AssemblyLoader - you won't need to use this class

Thanks for using Tungsten.Domains,

Jordan Duerksen
